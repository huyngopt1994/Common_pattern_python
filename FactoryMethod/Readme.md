#Advantage:
The goal is to move instances creating to subclasses
1. Make code not tied to concrete classes but to interact.It separates interfaces from their implementations.
2. It decouple the code that creates objects from the code that uses them, reducing the complexity of maintenance.
To add a new class, you need to add an additional else-if clause.

In this example We try to implement the small application for choosing with type of connector (HTTP/FTP) depend the
input parameter with choosing the specific port for per connectors.
